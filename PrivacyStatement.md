# Privacy statement for Task Organiser
## Overview
This is an app to organise tasks and tick them off as they are done.  It is aimed at independent supported living for users with memory difficulties.

The tasks can be edited and grouped into a tree of sub-tasks (actions).  Optionally, an SMS can be sent to a supporting adult to inform them that a task has been completed, for example leaving the house to go shopping, catching a bus and returning.

## Stored data
The tasks can be created, edited and deleted within the app. They are stored internally within the app data in an un-encrypted json file.

Optionally, a telephone number may be added to send selected task completion SMS messages to a support adult.  The telephone number is also stored internally un-encrypted with the app data.

The user can optionally save or load json data storing the tasks to Download folder on the phone.  This can serve as a permanent backup, or potentially to share task lists.

## Permissions
### SEND_SMS
If a task is selected to send an SMS then an SMS will be sent to the stored phone number when the task is completed, and a short message will also appear for the user indicating this occurred.
